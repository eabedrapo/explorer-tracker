# Abstract

This prototype is an effort to build a tool that helps to manage all stages of Exploratory Testing using [Session Based Test Management, SBTM](https://www.satisfice.com/download/session-based-test-management) from the planning of a charter to the debrief of every session associated with that charter.

This is still a work in progress.

# Initial Design

Images coming soon.
