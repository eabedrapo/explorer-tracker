# Abstract

This prototype is an effort to build a tool that helps to manage all stages of Exploratory Testing using [Session Based Test Management, SBTM](https://www.satisfice.com/download/session-based-test-management) from the planning of a charter to the debrief of every session associated with that charter.

This is still a work in progress.

# Initial steps to build the app

In order to get a working boilerplate using Node.js, MongoDB and Bootstrap I'm following James Hibbard's tutorial at [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/build-simple-beginner-app-node-bootstrap-mongodb/).

The initial structure of the project is shown in the file [`initialStructure.txt`](https://github.com/eabedrapo/explorer-tracker/master/design-documents/initial-structure.txt) in this repo. It will start evolving while I progress building this app.
